This is a executable program for extracting a Medial Axis Pore Network from binary images of porous media.

	PoreNetworkMedial.exe Berea500.nii 2.25 

The input parameters are a NIFITI type volume and the voxel resolution. The choice for NIFITI is to include Magnetic Resonance Imaging related images. The networkIO file includes python scripts to load and save NIFITI type images using nibabel.

The output are .txt files:

	_validate.txt 
	_skel.txt
	_nodes_skel.txt
	_all_nodes.txt
	_edges_graph.txt

The validate file contains:

	500 500 500 : the shape of the volume x,y,z
	Berea500.nii : name of the file
	2.25 : resolution that was input
	Total volume: 27094864 : total volume of the porous space in voxels
	:: Total sphere volume:27094864 : the total volume by summing the volume assigned to each sphere in voxels
	Total internal surface: 10974798 : estimated internal surface of the pore space in voxels
	:: Total sphere surface: 10974798 : total surface by summing the surface voxels assigned to each sphere in voxels
	Porosity %: 0.216759 : sample´s porosity (considering the shape in the first line)




_skel.txt  : contains the edges of the medial axis, the file is organized as:

	pore1_id pore2_id thoat_diameter

_nodes_skel.txt : contains the node information of the spheres selected of the medial axis, the file is organized as:

	nodeId x_index y_index z_index radius isBorder border_type  volume contact_surface

	x_index,y_index,z_index : sphere's center position
	radius: sphere's radius
	isBorder: is sphere is near the borders of the volume, this is set to 1, 0 otherwise
	border_type: integer value to identify the face that the sphere is connected to

	border_type = 1;:"inlet_x";	
	border_type = 2;:"inlet_y";	
	border_type = 3;:"inlet_z";
	
	border_type = 4;:"outlet_x";
	border_type = 5;:"outlet_y";
	border_type = 6;:"outlet_z";
	
	volume: Sphere's assigned volume in voxels.Each voxel is assigned to one sphere only.
	contact_surface: Sphere's contact area, an estimate of the voxels assigned to that sphere's volume that also belong to the pore space internal surface 

_all_nodes.txt : is the collection of all maximal spheres that completely fill the volume, the file is organized the same way as _nodes_skel.txt

_edges_graph.txt : the connections between spheres, this file is organized as _skel.txt
