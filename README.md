This is a executable program for extracting a Medial Axis Pore Network from binary images of porous media.

	PoreNetworkMedial.exe Berea500.nii 2.25 

The input parameters are NIFITI type volume data and the voxel resolution (usually in micrometers). The choice for NIFITI is to include Magnetic Resonance Imaging related images. The networkIO file includes python scripts to load and save NIFITI type images using nibabel.

The output are .txt files:

	_validate.txt 
	_skel.txt
	_nodes_skel.txt
	_all_nodes.txt
	_edges_graph.txt

The validate file contains:

	500 500 500 : the shape of the volume x,y,z
	Berea500.nii : name of the file
	2.25 : resolution that was input
	Total volume: 27094864 : total volume of the porous space in voxels
	:: Total sphere volume:27094864 : the total volume by summing the volume assigned to each sphere in voxels
	Total internal surface: 10974798 : estimated internal surface of the pore space in voxels
	:: Total sphere surface: 10974798 : total surface by summing the surface voxels assigned to each sphere in voxels
	Porosity: 0.216759 : sample's porosity 




_skel.txt  : contains the edges of the medial axis, composed by three columns:

	sphere1_id sphere2_id connection_diameter
	sphere1_id and sphere2_id: integers, indicating the connections between two spheres;
	connection_diameter: float value, the diameter of the connection.

_nodes_skel.txt : contains the node information of the spheres that composes medial axis network. The file is organized as follows:

	sphere_id x_index y_index z_index radius isBorder border_type  volume contact_surface

	x_index,y_index,z_index : integers, sphere's center position;
	radius: float, sphere's radius;
	isBorder: integer value. Set to 1 if the sphere touches volume borders, 0 otherwise;
	border_type: integer value to identify the face that the sphere is connected to;

	border_type = 1;:"inlet_x";	
	border_type = 2;:"inlet_y";	
	border_type = 3;:"inlet_z";
	
	border_type = 4;:"outlet_x";
	border_type = 5;:"outlet_y";
	border_type = 6;:"outlet_z";
	
	volume: integer, sphere's assigned volume in voxels. Each voxel is assigned to one sphere only;
	contact_surface: integer, sphere's contact area, an estimate of the voxels assigned to that sphere's volume that also belong to the pore space internal surface. 

_all_nodes.txt : is the collection of all maximal spheres that completely fill the volume, the file is organized the same way as _nodes_skel.txt

_edges_graph.txt : the connections between spheres, this file is organized as _skel.txt
